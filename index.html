## What is Six Pack League?

It is a format of the War Robots game played with intentionally limited equipment.

All weapons and bots are capped at level 6, and it's a completely component
free environment. Think of it as 'classic' War Robots. The meta is everything
up to and including the Wild West bots, and nothing after. 

At its heart, it represents an age old gaming ideal. When presented with a
level playing field, gamers who value true skill, sportsmanship, and teamwork
can come together for thrilling competition, and the closest, most intense
games you will find anywhere.

There is Six Pack league for teams and regular fight nights where anybody can come and play.


## Why Six Pack?

The aim is to emphasize the players skill and deemphasize the role of equipment.
No more chasing the latest meta bots and spending large sums of money on the game.
No more grinding for the latest great weapon.
We play with equipment that everybody can afford in reasonable amount of time.
